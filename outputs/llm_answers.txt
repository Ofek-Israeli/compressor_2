Based on the provided financial data for American Water Works Company, Inc. as of December , , we can calculate the working capital as follows:

Working Capital  Current Assets  Current Liabilities

Current Assets: , (Total current assets)

Current Liabilities: , (Total current liabilities)

Working Capital  ,  ,  ,

Since the working capital is negative (,), American Water Works Company, Inc. does not have positive working capital based on FY data.

However, it's worth noting that working capital can be a useful metric for some companies, but not necessarily for this one. Working capital represents the difference between a company's current assets and its current liabilities, which is essentially the amount of cash available to pay off debts or invest in new opportunities. For American Water Works, the negative working capital may indicate that the company has more debt than liquid assets, making it challenging to meet its shortterm obligations.

In this case, other metrics such as debttoequity ratio, interest coverage ratio, or return on equity might be more relevant and useful for evaluating the company's financial health.

The text does not explicitly state who the primary customers of Boeing are as of FY. However, it is mentioned that "We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines" and that "Fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers."

It can be inferred that the primary customers of Boeing are likely the major commercial airlines that purchase their aircraft. However, the text does not provide a specific list of these customers.

In FY,  of Boeing's revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include FMS through the U.S. government. This suggests that the U.S. government is also a significant customer for Boeing, but it is unclear whether this is the primary source of revenue or if it is part of a broader portfolio of customers.

 .

Rounded to two decimal places, Amazon's FY days payable outstanding (DPO) is approximately . days.

The driving factors behind the decrease in operating margin from . to . as of FY for M are:

. Increased cost of sales: The company experienced increases in cost of sales due to various factors such as special item costs related to PFASrelated matters, higher raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity headwinds, and investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability.
. Increased selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A): SG&A increased due to special item costs for significant litigation, impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia, divestiturerelated restructuring charges, and continued investment in key growth initiatives.

These increases in cost of sales and SG&A partially offset the increase in selling prices, resulting in a decrease in operating margin from . to ..

It's worth noting that operating margin may not be a useful metric for a company like M, which is involved in various complex business operations, including research and development, manufacturing, and divestitures. Operating margin primarily reflects the profitability of a company's core operations, but it does not account for onetime items, such as special item costs or goodwill impairment charges, that can significantly impact the company's financial performance.

In this case, the significant increases in cost of sales and SG&A due to various special item costs and divestitures may have masked underlying profitability, making operating margin a less accurate reflection of the company's overall financial health. A more comprehensive metric, such as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), or adjusted EBITDA, might provide a more complete picture of M's financial performance.

Based on the provided information, it appears that Amcor's restructuring liability as of December , , has been updated to reflect the changes in the liability balance.
